# The New Year's Omelet

### I have to try this!

#### Ingredients:
- 2 eggs
- 6 – 8 slices genoa salami
- ½ cup smashed potatoes
- 2 slices bacon
- 1 slice honey baked ham

#### Directions:
1. In a medium bowl, beat eggs, add a splash of milk or cream.
2. Heat skillet (I use 8” cast iron) to med heat or just under, too hot will scorch the eggs (I use a little cooking spray to ensure the eggs don’t stick)
3. Put eggs in the skillet.
4. Heat honey baked ham, smashed potatoes and genoa salami in microwave until hot
5. When eggs are almost completely cooked, add all the ingredients to one half of the omelet
6. Fold omelet over and let cook for 2 – 3 more minutes
7. Salt and pepper to taste (I usually use a hot sauce)
8. Indulge!
