# Uncle Jim's Goetta

- 3 teaspoons salt
- 1⁄2 teaspoon pepper ( I used 1 tsp pepper)
- 1 lb ground beef (73% Lean)
- 1 lb ground pork or 1 lb pork sausage ( I used Bob Evans Original sausage)
- 1 1⁄2 cups finely chopped onions
- 1⁄2 teaspoon sage
- 1⁄4 teaspoon thyme
- 4 bay leaves ( I used 6 bay leaves)
- 1⁄2 cup cornmeal (to thicken)

#### Directions
1. Place water, oats, salt and pepper into the crock pot and mix well.
2. Cover and cook on high for 1 hour, stirring 2 or 3 times.
3. Add meats and break up well.
4. Add onion, sage, thyme and bay, cook for 4 hours on low, stirring now and again.
5. Uncover and add cornmeal-stir well.
6. Cook uncovered for 30 minutes.
7. Turn out into 3 loaf pans, cool and chill in fridge.
8. When set turn out and freeze what you want.
9. Slice and fry in a little butter or oil until brown and crusty, but don't let them touch in the pan or they will run.
