# Goetta Quesadilla

### This should be a Cincy staple!

#### Ingredients
- Goetta (I use Glier's)
  - You could try [Uncle Jim's Goetta]({{site.github.url}}/Breakfast/UncleJimsGoetta/index.html)
- 1 Tortilla
- Shredded Cheese (I used a blended bag of cheese, I think it was mexican?)

#### Directions
1. Prepare goetta (I used some left over from Breakfast)
2. Warm goetta if desired
3. Place tortilla on a plate (normally I spritz a little water on my tortilla so it doesn't dry out)
4. Put desired amount of goetta on half of the tortilla ( I think I used 4 slices)
5. Cover the goetta with desired amount of cheese, I think I used about 2/3 cup
6. I microwaved for about 30 seconds to melt the cheese.
7. Indulge!
