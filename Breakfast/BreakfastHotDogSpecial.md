# Breakfast Hot Dog Special

### Hmmm.. Sounds weirdly good!

#### Ingredients:
- 1 egg
- 1 hot dog
- Onion slice(s)
- Tomato slice(s)
- Cheese slice(s) I think I used cheddar
- Pickle(s)
- 2 slices of bread
- Mayo

#### Directions
1. Over medium heat, fry the egg. I do over easy, but fry the egg how you like.
2. After you put the egg in the frying pan, slit hot dog length-wise and fry it in the pan with the eggs
3. Put the 2 slices of bread in the toaster and toast to your liking
4. Mayonnaise both slices of bread.
5. When egg is fried, remove hot dogs and place on toast
6. Place egg on top of hot dogs
7. Then place the tomato, onion, pickle and cheese on the sandwich
    - (if you would like your cheese a little melty, you can put it on the hot dogs for the last minute or so of frying)
8. Top it with the 2nd piece of toast and enjoy!
