# Amish Baked Oatmeal

#### Ingredients
- Eggs – this helps the mixture bind and stick together so it can be cut into squares.
- Maple syrup or light brown sugar – you can adjust the amount to taste, I’d recommend using at least 1/4 cup and no more than 3/4 cup.
- Baking powder – preferably use aluminum free baking powder. It doesn’t have that strange aftertaste.
- Cinnamon – in addition to cinnamon you can add other warm spices like nutmeg, ginger and cloves for extra flavor.
- Vanilla extract – use real vanilla extract for best flavor.
- Salt – this keeps it from tasting flat.
- Milk – I like to use whole or 2% milk here.
- Butter – salted or unsalted butter will work here.
- Rolled Oats – rolled old fashioned or quick oats can be used here.

#### Directions
1. Preheat oven and prepare baking dish: preheat oven to 350 degrees F and grease an 8×8-inch baking dish.
2. Whisk together everything except oats: in a large mixing bowl whisk together milk, eggs, maple syrup or brown sugar, melted butter, cinnamon, vanilla, baking powder and salt.
3. Mix in oats: add oats and stir in to blend.
4. Pour into baking dish and bake: pour into prepared baking dish, spread even and bake in preheated oven until set, about 30 – 40 minutes. Let cool slightly before slicing and serving.
