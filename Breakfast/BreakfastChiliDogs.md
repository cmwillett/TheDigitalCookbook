# Breakfast Chili Dogs

### Hmmm.. Sounds weirdly good!

#### Ingredients:
- Hotdog (split long ways)
- Bun
- Cincinnati Chili
- Mustard
- Onion
- Shredded cheddar cheese
- Egg

#### Directions
1. On a plate, open the hot dog bun all the way to lay flat.
2. Fry egg to desired doneness ( I prefer over-easy)
3. Add egg to skillet (medium heat)
4. Add hot dog to fry along with egg
5. While the hot dog and egg are frying, heat the chili to desired temp
6. When egg is finished, remove hot dog and place split and flat on the bun
7. Remove egg and place on the hot dog
8. Cover with desired amounts of mustard, onion, chili and cheese

#### Optional
For a little extra bang, top with your favorite hot sauce
