# Open Faced Brats and Eggs

### Hmmm.. Sounds weirdly good!

#### Ingredients:
- 1 Brat wurst
- 1 egg
- 1 hot dog bun
- diced onion
- Deli Mustard (I used Boar's Head)

#### Directions
1. Slit pre-cooked(or in my case, left over) Brats length-wise
2. In a skillet on medium heat, fry egg to how you like them. I did mine over-easy.
3. After you put the egg in the pan, add the brats
4. Take the hot dog bun and open it completely on a plate
5. When the egg is done how you like it, remove the brat from the pan and put it on the hot dog bun
6. Place the fried egg on the brat
7. Sprinkle with diced onion
8. Apply mustard as desired
9. ENJOY!
