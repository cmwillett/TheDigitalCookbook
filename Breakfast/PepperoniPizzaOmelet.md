# Pepperoni Pizza Omelet

### I have to try this!

#### Ingredients:
- 2 eggs (I used Large)
- Pepperoni slices
- 1/2 cup Mozzarella
- Spaghetti or Pizza sauce

#### Directions
1. Whisk the eggs, stir in a splash of milk or cream
  * I use an 8" cast iron skillet, heat to medium heat
2. Add all of the egg mixture to the skillet
3. When eggs are almost completely cooked add 2 - 3 Tbsp of your favorite spaghetti/pizza sauce
  * I usedÂ Classico Spicy Tomato Basil
4. Pepperoni to taste. I am a pepperoni lover, so I put about 12 or so pepperoni slices in.
  * You can microwave the pepperoni for about 15 seconds to "cook" it before adding to the omelet
6. Next add the Mozzarella.
7. Fold the eggs over and let cook till cheese is melty
  * if you are a cheese lover, top folded omelet with more Mozzarella!
