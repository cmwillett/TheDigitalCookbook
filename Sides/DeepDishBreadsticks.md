# Deep Dish Breadsticks

#### Ingredients:
- 14 ounce can refrigerated pizza crust (regular, not thin)
- 2 tablespoons butter, melted
- 1 tablespoon mined garlic
- 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, shredded or shaved
- 1/4 cup Romano cheese, grated

#### Directions:
1. Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray a 8 x 11 tall sided pan with non-stick cooking spray.
2. Shape the pizza dough into a long rectangle shape. Fold the dough in half, into a smaller rectangle. Place the dough in the prepared pan, pushing the crust up against the sides of the pan.
3. In a small bowl, combine the melted butter and garlic. Evenly brush the combination onto the pizza crust.
4. Place in the oven for 8 minutes, then remove. Use a pizza cutter or a butter knife to cut the dough into breadsticks. Sprinkle the mozzarella, Parmesan and Romano cheeses evenly across the breadsticks.
