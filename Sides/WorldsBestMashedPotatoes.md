# World's Best Mashed Potatoes

#### INGREDIENTS
- 2 1/2 pounds potatoes, peeled and cubed
- 1/4 cup butter
- 16 ounces sour cream, or to taste
- 1-2 cups shredded colby or cheddar cheese, optional
- salt, to taste
- pepper, to taste

#### DIRECTIONS
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
2. Prepare a casserole dish by spraying it with non-stick cooking spray.
3. In a medium-sized saucepan, add the peeled and cubed potatoes and cover them with water.
4. Cook the potatoes on the stove-top over medium heat until they are tender, about 10-15 minutes. Note that certain types of potatoes may take more or less time. Use a fork to test for tenderness.
5. Remove the saucepan from the stove and drain any water remaining in the pan. Return the saucepan to the stovetop and cook off any remaining water, for about 1 minute.
6. Put the tender potatoes and butter into a mixing bowl and mix at medium-high speed.
7. Add the sour cream slowly and whip until smooth and creamy.
8. Pour the potato mixture into the prepared casserole dish.
9. Top with the cheese.
10. Place the potatoes in the oven and bake until the cheese is bubbly and the edges begin browning, for about 20 minutes.
11. Season with salt and pepper, if desired, and serve warm!
