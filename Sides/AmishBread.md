# Amish Bread

#### Ingredients:
- 2 cups warm water
- ⅔ cup white sugar
- 1 ½ Tbsp active dry yeast
- 1 ½ tsp salt
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- 6 cups bread flour

#### Directions:
1. In a large bowl, dissolve the sugar in warm water, and then stir in the yeast. Allow to proof until yeast resembles a creamy foam
2. Mix salt and oil into the yeast. Mix in flour one cup at a time. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth. Place in a well oiled bowl, and turn dough to coat. Cover with a damp cloth. Allow to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
3. Punch dough down. Knead for a few minutes, and divide in half. Share into loaves, and place into two well oiled 9x5 inch loaf pans. Allow to rise for 30 minutes, or until dough had risen 1 inch above pans.
4. Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes
