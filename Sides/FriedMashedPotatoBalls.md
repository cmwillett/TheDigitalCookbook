# Fried Mashed Potato Balls

#### INGREDIENTS
- 3 cups leftover mashed potatoes
- 3 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled
- 2/3 cup cheddar cheese, shredded
- 2 tablespoons chives, thinly sliced
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- kosher salt, to taste
- ground black pepper, to taste
- 2 eggs, beaten
- 1 1/3 cups panko bread crumbs
- 2 cups vegetable oil, or more if needed for frying

#### DIRECTIONS
1. In a large bowl, mix the mashed potatoes with bacon, cheese, chives, and garlic powder.
2. Season with salt and pepper and stir to combine.
3. In two separate shallow bowls, divide the eggs and the panko breadcrumbs.
4. Scoop 1-2 inch balls of the mashed potato mixture and roll them into smooth, even spheres.
5. Dip each ball into the beaten eggs.
6. Then dip the egg-coated mashed potato balls into the panko breadcrumbs until thoroughly covered.
7. In a large cast-iron skillet over the stovetop, heat about 3 inches of oil to 375 degrees F.
8. In small batches, fry the mashed potato balls until golden brown, for about 2-3 minutes. Frying in small batches keeps the oil from becoming too cold and thus ruining the cooking process.
9. Once done, remove the mashed balls with a slotted spoon and drain them on paper towels.
10. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.
