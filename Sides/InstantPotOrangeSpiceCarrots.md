- 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
- 1/2 cup orange juice
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

#### DIRECTIONS
1. In a 6-qt. electric pressure cooker, combine the first seven ingredients. Lock lid; make sure vent is closed. Select manual setting; adjust pressure to low and set time for 3 minutes. When finished cooking, quick-release pressure according to manufacturer's directions.
