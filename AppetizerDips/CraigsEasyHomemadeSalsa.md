# Craig's Easy Homemade Salsa

#### Ingredients:
- 1 –14.5 ounce can diced tomatoes
- 1 –10 ounce can diced tomatoes with green chiles
- 3 cloves garlic
- 1/2 onion
- 1/2 jalapeno deseeded and membranes removed
- 1/2 tablespoon honey
- 1/2 cup cilantro
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- Juice from 1/2 lime

#### Directions:
1. Roughly chop up 1/2 an onion, 1 jalapeno (remove seeds as desired, the seeds will add heat), and 3 cloves of garlic.
2. Add to food processor.
3. Add in 1 can of diced tomatoes and 1 can of diced tomatoes with green chiles.
4. Add in honey, salt, 1/2 cup cilantro leaves, and juice of 1/2 lime (start slow with the lime as it can overpower, you can taste and add more if desired)
5. Blend in food processor for about 30 seconds or until desired consistency.

#### Additionals
- I add other spices and herbs based on feel for that day when I make it.
- Some I have tried are buttery herbs, garlic powder, 5 pepper and 5 salt blend...
