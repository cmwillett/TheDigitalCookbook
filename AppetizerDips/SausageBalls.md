# Sausage Balls

#### INGREDIENTS
- 1 pound sausage, uncooked
- 1 cup cheddar cheese, shredded
- 2 1/2 cups baking mix (such as Bisquick)
- dipping sauce of your choice, optional, for serving (syrup sounds good)

#### DIRECTIONS
1. Preheat your oven to 325 degrees F.
2. Mix the sausage, cheddar cheese, and baking mix in a large mixing bowl. You can use either a spatula or your hands. It should come to a consistency similar to dough.
3. Roll the sausage mixture into balls, around 1-inch to 1-2/3-inch around.
4. Place the sausage balls on an ungreased cookie sheet.
5. Bake for 25 minutes.
6. Remove from the oven and transfer to a serving plate.
7. Serve with your ideal dipping sauce.
