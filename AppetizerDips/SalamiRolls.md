# Salami Rolls

### These are perfect for that last minute party snack

#### Ingredients:
- 1 pound hard salami
- 1 pound cream cheese

#### Directions:
1. Using a butter knife, cut a dollop of cream cheese from the block
2. Place it on the edge of the salami
3. Roll the salami, starting with the edge that has the cream cheese on it
4. Place in plate/serving dish.
    - I lay them "seam" side down, but you could place a toothpick in it, starting with the "seam" to keep it rolled and it would also provide a "handle"
