# Authentic Mexican Salsa

#### Ingredients:
- 32 oz can crushed tomatoes
- 32 oz can of diced tomatoes
- 1/2 teaspoon of salt (or more to your taste)
- 1/4 teaspoon of crushed black pepper to taste
- 4 to 6 large cloves of crushed fresh garlic
- 1 large yellow or white onion, cut, chopped and diced finely
- 2 bushels of green onion, cut and chopped finely.  Discard the top green sections.
- 1 large handful of fresh cilantro leaves, cut and chopped finely.  Only use fresh!
- 1 diced jalapeno pepper
- Optional:  more jalapeno peppers, crushed red peppers, tabasco sauce, or a Habanero pepper (tailored to taste)

#### Directions:
1. Mix can of crushed tomatoes and can of diced tomatoes in a large bowl.
2. Add at least ¼ teaspoon of salt, or more to your taste, and at least ¼ teaspoon of crushed black pepper to suit your liking.
3. Add 4 to 6 large cloves of crushed fresh garlic (DO NOT USE GARLIC POWDER OR THE PRECRUSHED GARLIC IN A JAR. ONLY USE FRESH GARLIC!!!!!)
4. Add 1 large yellow or white onion, cut, chopped and diced finely.
5. Add 2 bushels of green onion, cut and chopped finely. Use at least half of the green part, but discard the top green sections.
6. Add one large handful of fresh Cilantro leaves, cut and chopped finely. Do not use anything but fresh here also. Even if you do not like the looks of these in the salsa, they are necessary for the flavor. Try to avoid using the stems.
7. Add one diced Jalepeno pepper at least. Add more to suit your taste. You can also tailor it with crushed red peppers and Tabasco sauce. If you really want it smoking, then add a Habenero pepper also, but beware it will be very hot.

#### Additionals
- Add a half cut of sour cream for a twist.
- A squeeze of a fresh lime slice adds a little different flavor as well.
- This dish is best when made at least 2 to 3 days in advance.
