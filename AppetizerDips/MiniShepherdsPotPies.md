5. To freeze: After placing pies in muffin cups, wrap muffin pan in foil, and freeze completely. Transfer frozen pies to labeled gallon-size resealable freezer bag. To bake: Heat oven to 375°F. Remove desired number of pies from bag, and place in sprayed muffin cups or ramekins on cookie sheet. Loosely tent with foil that has been sprayed with cooking spray; bake 20 minutes. Remove foil, and bake 8 to 10 minutes longer or until instant-read thermometer inserted in center reads 165°F.
