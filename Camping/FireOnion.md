# Fire Onion!

### This is super easy and a great camping snack!

#### Ingredients:
- Yellow sweet onion
- Butter
- Salt
- Pepper

#### Directions:
1. Peel the outer layer of the onion off
2. Slice downward on the onion to make an X (the onion will be in 4 chunks)
    - Don’t cut all the way thru though, keep the onion in tact (think of a blooming onion)
3. Put in aluminum foil
4. Toss plenty of butter on top of the onion
5. Salt and pepper
6. Close the aluminum foil up
7. Set next to the fire (or on the fire)
8. Turn as necessary, but cook until when you poke/squeeze it, it’s soft
9. Peel back foil and have at it!
