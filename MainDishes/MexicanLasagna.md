# Mexican Lasagna

#### Ingredients
- 1 bag Flour Tortillas
- 2 lbs “Mexican 4 cheese blend” shredded cheese (Monterey Jack, Cheddar, Queso Quesadilla, Asadero)
- 1 package queso fresco
- 1 lb Chorizo Sausage (I used just ground Chorizo by Johnsonville, you could cut links open if that is all you can find)
- 1 lb ground beef (use 2 lbs ground beef for meatier lasagna)
- 2 cans White Cheese Queso (Queso Blanco)
- 1 container salsa (At least 14 OZ)
- 2 cans Refried beans (I used Black refried beans)
- Enchilada Sauce (2 - 4 cans depending upon saucy preference)
- Cumin, Paprika, Ancho chili powder, cayenne powder
- 1 can each - Jalapeno, Chipotle, and green chilis
- ¼ - ½ cup Minced Garlic (I use the minced garlic from a jar)
- 1 box Spanish rice (I used Zatarain's)
- 2 cans black beans (I used Bush’s Black Bean Fiesta)
- 2 onions - Diced or chopped (your choice, I chopped mine)
- 2 sweet peppers (I used 1 yellow and 1 red) diced or chopped (I chopped mine)
- 1 can Black olives
- 1 bunch Green onions (Chopped the green tops for chives)
- 1 bunch cilantro, chopped

#### Instructions
1. Brown the ground beef and chorizo. I browned them separately so I could drain the fat from the ground beef, I did not drain chorizo because you lose a lot of the seasoning draining it.
2. After I browned the ground beef I added 1 teaspoon each Cumin, Paprika, Ancho Chili Powder and Cayenne pepper. (season to your taste) then combined with the Chorizo

#### Layer 1:
1. First, cut tortillas to fit the dimensions of your pan
2. I baked the tortillas @ 400 degrees to make them a little crisp (light brown) (couple minutes)
3. I put the first layer of tortilla on the bottom of the pan.
4. Thin coating of Enchilada Sauce(about ¾ of a can)
5. I put half the meat mixture
6. 1 can black beans
7. ½ - ¾ lb mix shredded cheese

#### Layer 2:
1. Another layer of baked Tortillas
2. 1 can white queso (spread evenly across tortillas, if you warm it first, it spreads a lot easier)
3. Another thin coating of enchilada sauce (approx ¾ can)
4. sprinkle chopped cilantro to taste (Save some for the top)
5. add Jalapenos, chipotle and green peppers.
6. Add Spanish rice (I put it all in this layer)

#### Layer 3:
1. Another layer of the baked tortillas
2. another thin coating of Enchilada sauce
3. the remaining meat mixture
4. Add the salsa
5. add the remaining refried beans
6. add the chopped onion and Sweet peppers
7. another ½ - ¾ lb of shredded cheese

#### Top:
1. Another layer of baked Tortillas
2. add a coating of enchilada sauce
3. add the remaining White Queso
4. add another ½ - ¾ lb shredded cheese
5. top with cilantro and chives (chopped green onion)
6. Top with Black Olives (I used the entire can) but olive to taste
7. Cover with aluminum foil and bake at 375 degrees for 45 - 60 minutes
8. Uncover and crumble Queso Fresco over the top
9. Bake an additional 20 - 30 minutes to brown the cheese a little
