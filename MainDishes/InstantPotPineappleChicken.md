# Instant Pot Pineapple Chicken

### This sounds fantastic!

#### Ingredients
- 3 pounds boneless skinless chicken breast
- 1 12 oz jar Trader Joe's Pineapple Salsa
- 2 20oz cans Dole Tropical Gold Pineapple chunks - drained
- 1/4 teaspoon Slap Ya' Mama (or other cajun seasoning)
- 1 teaspoon sea salt
- 1 1/2 cups water

#### Instructions
1. Place all ingredients into the pot liner of your Instant Pot.
2. Close and lock the lid, and turn the vent to closed position.
3. Place on High Manual Pressure for 12 minutes, and allow to NPR.
4. Once depressurized, open the vent to ensure that all pressure has been released.Â 
5. Pull out the chicken breasts onto a plate or cutting board, and shred with forks.
6. Once the chicken is shredded, add it back into your IP.
7. Let it set for a couple of minutes to marinate in that pineapple yumminess!

#### Notes
- Please note that some models of the Instant Pot does NOT give you control over High or low pressure settings. Some are automatically set to high.
- If you are using frozen chicken, it will take longer to come to pressure. Also, add an additional 5 minutes of cooking time on to it.
- You can cook your rice in the pineapple chicken broth that's in your IP! It will make it so flavorful.
- I used a 6qt Instant Pot, and it took about 9-10 minutes to come to pressure.
