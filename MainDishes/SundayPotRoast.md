- 3 pounds **[beef chuck roast](https://amzn.to/2tdXslc)**
- **[salt](https://amzn.to/2tAznb9)** to taste
- 4 tablespoons **[olive oil](https://amzn.to/2u7l9Pz)** divided
- 2 cups **[beef broth](https://amzn.to/2uzya4f)** *can use gluten-free beef broth
- 1 packet **[dry onion soup mix](https://amzn.to/2uwh74a)** *can use gluten-free onion soup mix
- 1 white or yellow onion, quartered
- 1 pound baby potatoes
- 1 cup **[baby carrots](https://amzn.to/2t3wVa7)**

#### INSTRUCTIONS
1. Sprinkle pot roast with salt and set aside.
2. Add 2 Tbsp. Olive oil to Instant Pot and set to "Saute".
3. When oil becomes hot and shimmery, add pot roast and sear for 4-5 minutes on each side.
4. Add beef broth to Instant Pot.
5. Add vegetables, 2 Tbsp. olive oil, and onion soup mix to a gallon-sized Ziploc bag and shake until vegetables become evenly coated with mix.
6. Put veggies in Instant pot and distribute evenly around roast.
7. Place lid on Instant pot with steam valve closed.
8. Switch Instant Pot setting to "manual" and set for 60-80 minutes on "high" pressure (70 minutes seems to work ok, judge the time depending on the size of your roast).
9. Do a natural release for at least 10 minutes, then quick release.
10. Remove roast from instant pot, slice, and serve with vegetables.
11. Use extra drippings from the instant pot to make gravy or au jus (see notes below to see how to make gravy).

#### Instant Pot Roast Gravy
Making gravy in the Instant Pot is a breeze. The easiest method is to remove the pot roast and vegetables when they are done cooking then switch the cook setting to “saute”. If there aren’t enough beef drippings to make a gravy, add some beef broth. Combine a little water and some corn starch in a liquid measuring cup to form a slurry. When the drippings and broth start to simmer, whisk in the cornstarch mixture a little at a time until it becomes a gravy consistency. Simmer about 3 minutes adding more beef broth to thin if needed. Add salt and pepper to taste.
