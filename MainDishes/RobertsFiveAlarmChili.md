# Robert's 5 Alarm Chili

### Get in my mouth!

#### Ingredients:
- 1 can each: 15 oz (I prefer Red Gold)
    - diced tomatoes
    - petite diced tomatoes
    - chili ready diced tomatoes
    - diced tomatoes with green chilies
    - crushed tomatoes
    - stewed tomatoes
    - whole peeled tomatoes
    - tomato sauce
- 1 can tomato paste ( I use the small one, 6 or 8 oz?) Adds bold tomato flavor
- 1 can each: 15 oz ( I prefer Bush's)
    - black beans
    - pinto beans
    - chili ready beans (hot if available)
    - light kidney beans
    - dark kidney beans
    - great northern beans
    - (sometimes any other bean I see on the shelf - Cannellli beans and Garbanzo beans)
- 1 can Chipotle peppers in Adobo sauce, 7 oz (I use Le Costina) (the peppers are whole, so you can chop or dice if prefer)
- optional:  for a little more kick, I will add a can of diced green chilies, or I may dice up some pepperoncini or add some Jalapeno rings (sometimes I add them all hehe)
- 1 lb Ground Beef
- 1 lb ground Chorizo Sausage (I use Johnsonville)
- 1 Onion quartered
- 1/2 cup sugar ( I use white, but I am thinking about using turbinado or brown sugar)
- Worcestershire sauce

#### Spices:
- Cloves 1/2 - 1 tsp
- Curry Powder 1 - 2 tbsp
- Turmeric 1 or so tbsp
- Cayenne 2 or so tbsp
- white pepper - 1 - 2 tbsp
- black pepper - 1 or so tbsp
- Ancho Chili Powder 2 - 3 tbsp (more smoky than hot, delicious!)
- Paprika - 2 - 3 tbsp
- Chili Powder - 5 or so tbsp
- Cinnamon - 1 - 2 tsp
- Coarse ground garlic salt - 1 - 2 tbsp (Lawry's)
- onion powder - 2 tsp

#### Instructions:
1. Put all the canned goods into a large pot ( I believe mine is at least 10 quarts)
    - I normally drain the beans (if you don't drain the beans the chili will have more liquid. I prefer thick chili, so I drain them)
2. Stir everything together
3. Turn burner med/med low to start heating the ingredients in the pot
4. in a skillet (I use 12" cast iron) brown the ground beef and chorizo.
5. I add several shakes of coarse ground garlic salt (Lawrey's) and 6 or so shakes of Worcestershire Sauce ( I use lea and Perrins)
6. While the ground meat is browning I add the spices to the pot, two or 3 at a time and then stir them in. I have a tendency to add a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce to the pot.
7. I also quarter the onion and add it to the pot.
8. When the ground meat is browned, I drain the fat off using a strainer over the sink and then add the meat to the pot.
9. I now have the heat on med - med high until I get some good bubbling action, stirring frequently (every 10 -15 minutes) to prevent burning/scorching.
10. After an hour or so of this (normally the onions are turning translucent) I will reduce heat to med low and simmer for a few hours, stirring occasionally (every 15 - 30 minutes).
    - The beans tend to settle to the bottom and will stick without regular stirring intervals.
