# French Onion Baked Chicken

#### Ingredients:
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- 4-5 large yellow or white onions, peeled and sliced in half
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 2 sprigs of fresh thyme
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
- 2/3 cup reduced-sodium beef broth
- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 cup shredded Mozzarella or Gruyere
- 1/3 cup shredded Parmesan

#### Directions:
1. Heat a large skillet over medium/medium-high heat. Add the butter, olive oil, and sliced onions. Season with 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Add the thyme sprigs and cook for 8 minutes, stirring very occasionally.
2. While the onions are cooking, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and butter a 9"x13" baking dish. Set it aside.
3. After 8 minutes, reduce the heat on the pan of onions down to medium/medium-low, and cook them for another 15 minutes or so, stirring occasionally.
4. Stir in the garlic, cook for 1 minute. Stir in the balsamic vinegar and 1/3 cup of the beef broth. Stir and cook for another minute or so, until the onion mixture is thick with a jam-like consistency.
5. Add about a 1/2 cup of the caramelized onions to the prepared baking dish and add the remaining 1/3 cup beef broth to the dish. Stir.
6. Season the chicken breasts on both sides with salt, black pepper, dried thyme, and garlic powder. Arrange chicken in a prepared baking dish and top each breast with a generous spoonful of caramelized onions.
7. Top the chicken and onions with Mozzarella and Parmesan.
8. Bake for 25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees F.
