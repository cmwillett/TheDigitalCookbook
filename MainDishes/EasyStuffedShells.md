# Easy Stuffed Shells

#### Ingredients:
- 36 uncooked jumbo pasta shells
- 1 jar (24 ounces) spaghetti sauce
- 36 frozen fully cooked Italian meatballs (1/2 ounce each), thawed
- 2 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
    - Note: i like more sauce, so i usually add 2 cans/jars instead of 1

#### Instructions:
1. Preheat oven to 350Â°. Cook pasta shells according to package directions; drain and rinse in cold water.
2. Spread 1/2 cup sauce into a greased 13x9-in. baking dish. Fill each shell with a meatball; place over sauce. Top with remaining sauce and the cheese.
3. Bake, covered, 35 minutes. Uncover; bake 3-5 minutes longer or until bubbly and cheese is melted.
