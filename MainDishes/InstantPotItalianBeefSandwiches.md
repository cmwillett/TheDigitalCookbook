# Instant Pot Italian Beef Sandwiches

### We fell in love with Italian beef sandwiches from a place called Portillos in Chicago.  Had to find a way to make them in the instant pot at home!

#### Ingredients
- 1 3 pound chuck roast
- 1 cup low sodium beef broth
- 1 teaspoon sea salt
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon dried minced onions
- 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning mix
- 1 cup sliced pepperoncini peppers with juice (about 1/2 of a 16-ounce jar)
- hard rolls
- provolone cheese

#### Instructions
1. Cut chuck roast into 3 pieces, and place in the Instant Pot
2. Season with Italian seasoning, sea salt, garlic powder, onions and pepper
3. Pour beef broth around the meat, and top with pepperoncini peppers and small amount of juice
4. Place lid on Instant Pot, turn vent to Sealing position, and hit PRESSURE COOK for 50 minutes. Pot will take a few minutes to come to pressure, then cook for 50 minutes and beep when done. Allow 10 to 15 minutes natural release, then do quick release to release remaining pressure
5. When pin drops, open lid, and shred beef -- you can do this on another plate. Return meat to pot to soak up more juice, or make sandwiches, and serve with juice on the side
6. To make sandwiches, place sliced provolone cheese on both sides of a cut roll, add shredded beef, place on baking sheet, and bake in 350 degree oven until cheese melts. Top with additional pepperoncini and more juice, if desired
