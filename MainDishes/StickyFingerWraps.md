# Sticky Finger Wraps

#### Ingredients:
- 1/3 cup hot sauce
- 3/4 cup brown sugar
- 1/4 cup water
- 8 breaded chicken fingers
- 4 flour tortillas (burrito size)
- 2 cups cheddar cheese, shredded
- 1 small tomato, sliced
- 2 cups chopped lettuce

#### Directions:
1. In a medium saucepan, over medium heat, stir the hot sauce, brown sugar, and water until sugar is dissolved and sauce is heated thoroughly, or about 5-10 minutes.
2. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let it stand for a few minutes to thicken.
3. Place the cooked chicken fingers in a large bowl. Pour the sauce over the chicken fingers. Gently toss with tongs to coat all of the chicken in sauce.
4. Place two sauce-coated chicken fingers onto one tortilla. Add the desired amount of cheese, lettuce, and tomato. Wrap it up and serve immediately. Enjoy!
