# Tortilla Chip And Pepper Jack Crusted Chicken With Avocado And Jalapeno Ranch

#### Ingredients:
- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- One 12-ounce bag tortilla chips
- 4 ounces Pepper Jack cheese, shredded
- 1 C mayonnaise
- 1/2 T garlic powder
- 1/2 T cumin
- 1/2 T chili powder
- 2 teaspoons lime juice

#### Sauce:
- 1 C mayo
- 1/2 C buttermilk
- 1 C sour cream
- 1 packet Ranch dip mix
- 1 T garlic powder
- 1 T onion powder
- 1-3 T diced jalapeno slices (from a jar)
- 1 teaspoon lime juice
- 2 avocados

#### Directions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2. Put about half of the bag of chips into the food processor and blend. You should have 2-3 C crushed chips. (Reserve the rest of the bag in case you don't have enough.) Mix the shredded cheese and the crushed chips together.
3. Whisk together the mayo, garlic powder, chili powder, cumin, and lime juice. Dredge the chicken breasts into the mayo and then into the chip mixture, pressing down to make sure it's all coated. (Here's where you may need to grind extra chips for coating if you run out.) When all the chicken is coated, put it in the oven and bake for about 25-30 minutes or until the chicken is done all the way through and the chips are crispy.
4. Blend the sauce ingredients together in a food processor and serve over the chicken.
