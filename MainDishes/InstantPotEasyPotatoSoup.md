# Instant Pot Tuna Casserole!

#### Ingredients
- 1/4 cup bacon bits
- 32 oz box chicken broth or stock
- 2 10.5 oz cans condensed cream of chicken soup
- 32 oz bag frozen diced hash brown potatoes
- 8 oz block cream cheese

#### Instructions
1. Pour the bacon bits into the bottom of the Instant Pot. I don't typically measure, and just use about half of the little Bacon Bits bag. If desired, set the Instant Pot to saute for 2-4 to help crisp up the bacon.
2. Pour the chicken broth/stock into the pot, followed by the cream of chicken soup. Give the Instant Pot contents a gentle stir to distribute the cream of chicken soup.
3. Pour the frozen hash brown potatoes gently over the soup. Add the cream cheese to the Instant Pot and gently poke it down under the surface of the soup and potatoes. For best results, cut the cream cheese into 8 equal slices.
4. Put the lid onto the Instant Pot, and set it to cook at high pressure for 15 minutes. When cooking time has finished, allow the pressure to release naturally.
5. Top with shredded cheese, bacon bits, and/or green onion if desired!
