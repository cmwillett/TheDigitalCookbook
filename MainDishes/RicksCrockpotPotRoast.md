# Rick's Crockpot Pot Roast

### All I have to say is Rick, keep bringing this to the camping trips!

#### Ingredients:
- 3 lbs. Chuck Roast
- 4 Russet Potatoes
- one 1 lb. Bag Mini Carrots
- 1 Yellow Onion

#### Ingredients To Taste
- Adolph's Meat Tenderizer
- Lawry's Seasoned Salt
- Black Pepper and Salt

#### Directions:
1. Peel potatoes, cut into chunks.
2. Place 2 potatoes mixed with half the bag of carrots in bottom of crockpot.
3. Coat roast with meat tenderizer, seasoned salt, black pepper and salt.
4. Place roast on top of potatoes and carrots.
5. Add the rest of the potatoes and carrots.
6. Peel and slice onion into 1-inch slices.
7. Place a full layer of onion slices over the top of the roast.
8. Add water, leaving about 1 inch of roast exposed above water line.
9. Sprinkle top with pepper.
10. Cook on low for 8-10 hours.
**Note:**  You can always add some other spices and mix some things up.
Top or round roast works too.  I add another potato sometimes.
Yukon potatoes are excellent as well.
