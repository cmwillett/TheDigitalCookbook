# Instant Pot Just Plain Drumsticks

### Just plain old chicken drumsticks, done super quick!

#### Ingredients
- 1 cup water
- Fresh (or thawed) Drumsticks

#### Directions
- Season drumsticks if you want to
- Pour water in instant pot
- Put trivet in instant pot
- Add drumsticks to instant pot (I cooked 10 at a time standing upright)
- Cook on high pressure for 20 minutes
- If desired, add bbq sauce afterwards and broil for 2 minutes, flip, broil 2 minutes more (this will make them crispy)
