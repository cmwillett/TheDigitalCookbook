# Instant Pot Tuna Casserole!

#### Ingredients
- 1/4 cup butter, cubed
- 1/2 pound sliced fresh mushrooms
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 1 medium sweet pepper, chopped
- 1 teaspoon salt, divided
- 1 teaspoon pepper, divided
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 cups reduced-sodium chicken broth
- 2 cups half-and-half cream
- 4 cups (8 ounces) uncooked egg noodles
- 3 cans (5 ounces each) light tuna in water
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese
- 2 cups frozen peas, thawed
- 2 cups crushed potato chips

#### Instructions
1. Select saute setting on a 6-qt. electric pressure cooker and adjust for high heat. Add butter. When melted, add mushrooms, onion, sweet pepper, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper; cook and stir until tender, 6-8 minutes. Add garlic; cook 1 minute longer. Stir in flour until blended. Gradually whisk in broth. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly; cook and stir until thickened, 1-2 minutes.
2. Stir in cream and noodles. Lock lid; make sure vent is closed. Select manual setting; adjust pressure to high, and set time for 3 minutes. When finished cooking, allow pressure to naturally release for 3 minutes, then quick-release any remaining pressure according to manufacturer's directions.
3. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine tuna, lemon juice and remaining salt and pepper. Select saute setting, and adjust for low heat. Stir cheese, tuna mixture and peas into noodle mixture. Cook until heated through. Just before serving, sprinkle with potato chips.
