# Spicy Enchilada Casserole

#### Ingredients:
- 1-1/2 pounds ground beef
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 1 cup water
- 2 to 3 tablespoons chili powder
- 1-1/2 teaspoons salt
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
- 2 cups salsa, divided
- 10 flour tortillas (8 inches), cut into 3/4-inch strips, divided
- 1 cup sour cream
- 2 cans (15-1/4 ounces each) whole kernel corn, drained
- 4 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese

#### Directions:
1. In a large skillet, cook beef and onion over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Stir in the water, chili powder, salt, pepper and garlic powder. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes.
2. Place 1/4 cup salsa in each of two greased 8-in. square baking dishes. Top each with a fourth of the tortillas and 1/4 cup salsa.
3. Divide the meat mixture, sour cream and corn between the two casseroles. Top with remaining tortillas, salsa and cheese.
4. Cover and freeze one casserole for up to 1 month. Cover and bake second casserole at 350Â° for 35 minutes. Uncover; bake 5-10 minutes longer or until heated through.
