# Chicken and Dumplins

#### Ingredients:
- 1 Rotisserie Chicken
- 2 small cans of biscuits (not flaky)
- 1 can Cream of Chicken soup
- 1 32oz box of chicken stock
- 1 ½ cups of milk
- ½ tsp poultry seasoning
- ½ tsp black pepper
- ½ stick of butter
- ¼ cup flour
- ¾ cup milk

#### Directions:
1. Remove all the chicken from the bones and dice. Set chicken aside.
2. Cut the biscuits into ½” pieces (roll each biscuit between your hands forming long tube; then cut into half inch pieces)
3. Set biscuits on a cookie sheet and keep them separated. Place in the refrigerator
4. In a large pot, combine chicken stock, cream of chicken soup and milk, whisking together until soup is dissolved. Add poultry seasoning and black pepper
5. Bring to full boil and then add real butter; reducing the heat to medium so that the liquid continues to simmer not boil
6. When the butter melts, start dropping the biscuits into the boiling liquid. Stir occasionally reducing heat to medium or low
7. Once all the biscuits have been added to the liquid, let them boil lightly as you prepare a thickener. To make thickener, combine ¼ cup of flour, ¾ cup milk; thoroughly stir together
8. Slowly add thickener to the liquid and biscuits stirring constantly. This will slightly thicken the liquid
9. Once liquid begins to thicken, add diced chicken. Let this mixture cook, covered, for approximately 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. When the biscuits are no longer doughy but firm, it is ready to be served
