# Skillet Chicken Parmesan

### Servings: 4
### Chicken, cheese, and pizza sauce?

#### Ingredients:
- 1/3 cup breadcrumbs
- 1/3 cup grated parmesan cheese
- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/4 teaspoon garlic salt
- 1 large egg
- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 pound)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 3/4 cup marinara sauce
- 3/4 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese

#### Instructions:
1. In a shallow bowl, mix together the breadcrumbs, parmesan cheese, oregano, and garlic salt.
2. In another bowl, beat the egg until frothy.
3. Wrap the chicken breasts in plastic wrap and place on a cutting board.
4. Gently pound each breast with a mallet to an even thickness (about 1/2 inch thick).
5. Dip each chicken breast into the beaten egg to coat, and then roll in the breadcrumb mixture.
6. Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.
7. Add the chicken and cook for 4 to 5 minutes on each side, or until the chicken is well browned and just cooked through.
8. Spoon the marinara sauce evenly on top of the chicken, and sprinkle the mozzarella on top.
9. Cover the pan, reduce heat to low, and cook for 3 more minutes, or until the cheese melts.
