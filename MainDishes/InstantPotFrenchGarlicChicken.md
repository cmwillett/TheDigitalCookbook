# Instant Pot French Garlic Chicken!

#### Marinade Ingredients
- 2 teaspoons herbes de Provence
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs

#### Cooking Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 8 garlic cloves, chopped
- 1/4 cup water
- 1/4 cup heavy whipping cream

#### Instructions
1. Mix all the ingredients for the marinade, using a wire whisk to emulsify the oil and vinegar together.
2. Add chicken thighs and allow to marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes. If you need to marinate for longer, put in the refrigerator.
3. Turn your Instant Pot to Sauté and when it's hot, add the butter and allow it to melt.
4. Add chopped garlic and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes.
5. Add in the chicken, leaving behind as much of the marinade as you can. (Do not discard the marinade!)
6. Cook the chicken thighs so that they can lightly brown on one side, 3 to 5 minutes.
7. Add the marinade and 1/4 cup water.
8. Close the Instant Pot and set it to cook at high pressure for 5 minutes. Allow it to release pressure naturally for 10 minutes, and then release all remaining pressure.
9. Remove the chicken to a plate and add 1/4 cup cream into the pot, mixing well with the remaining liquid.
10. As soon as the sauce thickens, pour it onto the chicken thighs and serve.
