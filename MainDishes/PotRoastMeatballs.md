# Pot Roast Meatballs

#### Ingredients:
- 2 russet potatoes, peeled and chopped into 1-inch cubes.
- 2 1/2 teaspoons salt, divided
- 2 ounces sour cream
- 1/3 ounce butter
- 2 teaspoons chives, chopped, divided
- 10 ounces ground beef
- 1/4 cup Italian breadcrumbs
- 1 1/2 teaspoons pot roast seasoning
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 4 teaspoons beef flavor demi-glace concentrate

#### Directions:
1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
2. Line a baking sheet with foil.
3. Bring a medium pot with the potatoes, 8 cups of water, and 2 teaspoons of salt to a boil on the stovetop.
4. Reduce the water to a simmer and cook until the potatoes are easily pierced with a forkâ€”about 18 to 20 minutes.
5. Drain the potatoes in a colander and return them to the pot.
6. Add the sour cream, butter, 1 teaspoon of the chives, and 1/4 teaspoon salt.
7. Mash until smooth.
8. Combine the ground beef, breadcrumbs, pot roast seasoning, and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt in a mixing bowl.
9. Divide and roll the mixture into six golf ball-sized meatballs.
10. Heat 1 teaspoon of olive oil over medium heat in a large frying pan on the stovetop.
11. Add the meatballs to the hot pan, stirring often until browned on all sides, about 4-6 minutes.
12. Remove the meatballs from the pan, placing them on the prepared baking sheet.
13. Roast them in the oven until the meatballs reach a minimum internal temperature of 160 degrees F, around 10- 12 minutes.
14. While the meatballs roast, make the sauce in a small bowl by stirring the cornstarch and 1 tablespoon of water until they are combined.
15. Return the pan used to sear the meatballs to medium-high heat.
16. Add the beef demi-glace and cornstarch-water slurry to the pan and bring to a boil, stirring to combine.
17. Remove the meatballs, plate them, and spoon the sauce over them, garnishing the mash with the remaining chives.
18. Serve hot!
