# Sweet Potato Black Bean Burgers

#### Ingredients:
- 1½ cups rolled oats
- 1 cup peeled, mashed, cooked sweet potato
- 1 cup mashed black beans
- ½ tsp. salt
- 2 tsp. onion powder
- 1 tsp. ground cumin
- 1 tsp. smoked paprika
- ½ tsp. black pepper
- ½ tsp. chipotle powder (optional)
- Oil for cooking

#### Directions:
1. Pulse the rolled oats in a food processor until coarsely ground and set aside.
2. Combine the sweet potato, black beans, salt and spices; then incorporate the ground oats. Let this sit for about 5 minutes so flavors can marry.
3. Form the mixture into 4 patties. In a skillet, heat a thin layer of oil over medium heat.
4. Add the patties and fry on both sides until crisped, about 4 minutes per side.
