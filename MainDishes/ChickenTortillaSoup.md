# Chicken Tortilla Soup

### Not that healthy, but easy, quick and always satisfying!

#### Ingredients:
- 1 large family size Campbell's Chicken with Rice soup (or 2 regular size soup cans)
- 1 large can (same as a family size can of soup) Ranch style beans
- 2 cans Rotel tomatoes and green chilies (mild, unless you like it hotter)
- 1 avocado (sliced)
- Cooked, cubed chicken breasts (I like the rotisserie chicken that is already in a container off the bone, much easier)
- Shredded Mexican Style Cheese

#### Directions:
1. Dump all ingredients into a large pot, Bring to a boil, then simmer for 20 minutes or so.
2. Ladle into bowls, add the avocado slices and cheese.
3. Serve with tortilla chips.
