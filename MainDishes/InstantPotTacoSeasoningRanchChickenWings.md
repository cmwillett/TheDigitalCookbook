# Instant Pot Taco Seasoning Ranch Chicken Wings

### Taco flavor, ranch, okay...

#### Ingredients
- 1 1/3 pound chicken wings about 12 wings
- 4 tbs taco seasoning
- 1 1/2 tsp smoked salt

#### Instructions
1. In a shallow dish mix the spices together
2. Roll each wing in the spices gently, the spice don't need to cover the whole wing
3. In your instapot- add 1 cup of water
4. Add a steamer basket to the bottom of your instapot 
5. Add your wings to the steamer basket. They can touch but should not be on top of each other. Instead I turned my on their ends to fit the 12
6. Close and lock the lid. Make sure the pot is set to sealing. Hit Manual and set for 10 minutes at high pressure.
7. When the pot has cooked for 10 minutes at high pressure, carefully with a pan holder or some hand protection vent the pot. Once the pot has come back to regular pressure open the lid and remove the wings to a baking sheet.
8. Broil wings for 10 minutes for crispy skin. Enjoy!
