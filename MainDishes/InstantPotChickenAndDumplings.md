  - 1/2 teaspoon salt
  - 1 teaspoon baking soda
  - 2 teaspoons baking powder
  - 3 Tablespoons butter
  - 3/4 cup milk

#### Instructions
* Chicken Soup
  1. Saute the onions in a little oil in the Instant Pot using the saute setting.
  2. After the onions have cooked for about 5 minutes or until they are softened add the celery, carrots, and garlic. Stir so they cook evenly and to keep the garlic from burning.
  3. Add the chicken and cook with the vegetables for about 5 minutes.
  4. Add the chicken broth, black pepper, poultry seasoning, salt, and Italian seasoning.
  5. Remove 5 refrigerated canned biscuits and slice each biscuit into 8 pieces. The easiest way is to slice them like a pizza into 8 pieces. Then drop each of the pieces into the Instant Pot.
  6. Close the Pressure Cooker lid. (See instructions for your specific pressure cooker.) Pressure Cook on High for 7 minutes.
  7. After 7 minutes, let the Instant Pot release go through the natural release cycle to release the steam. (See instructions for your specific model.) It may take about 10 minutes.
    * Carefully unlock and remove the lid.
  8. Stir in the peas and heavy cream.
  9. If you need to thicken the chicken and dumplings, combine 2 tablespoons of cornstarch with 1/4 cup of cold water and stir into the chicken and dumplings.
  10. Add chopped parsley or cilantro for garnish.
* Homemade Dumplings
  1. In a medium bowl mix together all ingredients, except the butter and milk.
  2. Cut in the butter and using a pastry cutter or fork mix together until you have coarse crumbs. Pour in milk and stir until everything is just moistened.
  3. Drop teaspoonfuls of dumpling batter into the Instant Pot after you added the chicken and chicken broth.
