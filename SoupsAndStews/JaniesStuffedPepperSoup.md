# Janie's Stuffed Pepper Soup

### I'll be honest, I haven't made this one yet, but it sounds delicious!

#### Ingredients
- 1 Lb Leand Ground Beef (93%)
- 1 Lg onion, diced
- 1 Cup uncooked or 2 cups cooked rice
- 1 can Hunts diced tomatoes (flavored perferrably) 14.5 oz
- 1 can tomato sauce
- 1 tsp oregano
- 1 tsp basil
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp pepper
- 2 cups water
- 2 tbsp beef boullion
- 3 bell peppers chopped (Green, red & yellow)
- Cheese for topping (optional)
- Fresh Cracked pepper for garnish (optional)

#### Directions
1. In a large pot, add a little olive oil to the bottom, then over medium high heat, brown ground beef with onions & rice. I know it sounds odd, but browning the rice gives it a nutty flavor - do not allow to burn!
2. As meat browns, the mixture will thicken, so mix often to avoid burning. Add in the rest of the ingredients except for the peppers and allow it to come to a boil.
3. Reduce heat, cover and allow it to cook 20 minutes then add peppers. Cook another 20-30 minutes or until rice is tender. Top with cheese (Your choice) if you want and enjoy.
