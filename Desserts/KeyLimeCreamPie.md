# Key Lime Cream Pie

#### Ingredients
- 1 package pecan shortbread cookies, crushed (about 2 cups)
- 1/3 cup butter, melted
- 4 cups heavy whipping cream
- 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar
- 1 teaspoon coconut extract
- 1 package (8 ounces) cream cheese, softened
- 1 can (14 ounces) sweetened condensed milk
- 1/2 cup key lime juice
- 1/4 cup sweetened shredded coconut, toasted
- optional garnish: sliced key limes

#### Directions
1. In a small bowl, mix the crushed cookies and butter. Press the mixture onto the bottom and up the sides of a greased 9-inch deep-dish pie plate.
2. In a large bowl, beat the cream until it begins to thicken. Add confectioners' sugar and extract; beat until stiff peaks form.
3. In another large bowl, beat the cream cheese, condensed milk, and lime juice until blended. Fold in 2 cups of whipped cream.
4. Spoon the mixture into the prepared crust. Top it with the remaining whipped cream, and sprinkle with the toasted coconut.
5. Refrigerate until ready to serve, at least 4 hours. If desired, garnish with limes.
