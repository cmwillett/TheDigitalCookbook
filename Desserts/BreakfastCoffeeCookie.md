# Breakfast Coffee Cookie

### A breakfast cookie?  With coffee in it?  I'm intrigued!

### Makes about 30 cookies
#### Ingredients
- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- 3/4 cup all purpose flour
- 1/2 cup cocoa powder
- 1.5 tablespoons instant coffee (or finely ground coffee)
- 1.5 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 3 whole eggs, lightly beaten
- 1 ripe banana, microwaved for 30 seconds and mashed
- 1/2 cup plain nonfat or low fat greek yogurt
- 1/2 cup honey
- 1 tablespoon canola oil
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 and 1/4 cups blueberries, rinsed and patted dry
- 1/2 cup dark or semi-sweet chocolate chips

#### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Mist a large cookie sheet (or two standard size) with oil spray and set aside.
3. In a large mixing bowl, add both flours, cocoa powder, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, and instant coffee.
4. Mix until well combined.
5. In a separate bowl, add the wet ingredients:  eggs, mashed banana, yogurt, honey, oil, and vanilla.
6. Stir until everything is well combined and the banana is thoroughly mashed (if small pieces remain, that's okay).
7. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry, gently stirring until fully incorporated.
8. Fold in the blueberries and chocolate chips (or you save the chocolate chips to sprinkle on top before baking). Do not overmix!
9. Prepare the cookies for the oven by dropping a heaping tablespoon of batter, one at a time, on to the baking sheet.
10. The batter will be very sticky, so mist the spoon or your hands with oil spray if needed.
11. Flatten each cookie by gently pressing the tops with the back of a fork (be sure to mist the fork with oil spray to prevent sticking).
12. Top each cookie with a sprinkling of optional chocolate chips.
13. Bake for 12 - 15 minutes.
14. Let cool and enjoy!
  * Note:  To freeze, allowe to cool on counter for at least an hour.  Then, wrap each cookie individually or put 2 - 3 together in small bags and stash in freezer.  Take out and allow to thaw at room temperature or quickly defrost in microwave for about 30 seconds.
