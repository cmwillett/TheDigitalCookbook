### Career/Work Information

#### Summary
* I have worked in the IT world since around 2001.  It's been an interesting journey.
* After college, I started at 5/3 bank as a PC Technician
  * I drove from bank to bank around the area to fix pcs, printers, and/or monitors.
  * I eventually moved on from there to the help desk
    * Here I learned all sorts of new skills.  You had to be pretty diverse because you got calls for literally everything; and you had to know how to take care of each.
  * After the help desk, I moved onto doing Crystal Reports.  I finally started writing some code, albeit not the type of code I went to school for!
* After 5/3, I moved onto Cincinnati Insurance Companies as a Tester.
* I did that for a couple years and then moved into test automation.
  * I quickly realized this is the career path I wanted!
* And I've been in test automation eversince - of course I'm at GAIG now...
* Over the last few years, I have become an expert in test automation.  I have successfully migrated just about all of our existing UFT tests to Selenium - saving us lots of dough on licensing costs.
* I've also helped with making our selenium framework to be as stable as I've ever witnessed in test automation by setting up our synchronization that runs in between each and every step.

#### Education
* Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Cincinnati
  * I have always enjoyed math - I wound up just a few courses short of minor in math
