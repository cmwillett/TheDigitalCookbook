### Want the app for your phone?  Sorry, all I have is Android.  If anyone out there is an Apple Developer and wants to build me an iOS app, let me know!  I already have the code...

[Download the TDC app here and follow the instructions below...]({{site.github.url}}/TDC.apk "download")

* Click the link above
* Choose Download/Install

        ![]({{site.github.url}}/tdcInstall1.jpg){:height="600px" width="400px"}

* Probably have to click on the "More..." option if the "Unsafe app blocked" window comes up.  Then click "Install anyway"

        ![]({{site.github.url}}/tdcInstall2.jpg){:height="600px" width="400px"}

* App should install just fine and then click open/done

        ![]({{site.github.url}}/tdcInstall3.jpg){:height="600px" width="400px"}
