# Red Skinned Smashed Potatoes

### Sounds good to me!

#### Ingredients:
- 6 larger red skin potatoes (baseball sized, or larger)
- ½ stick butter
- 2 tbsp Sour cream
- Milk
- Pepper
- Salt

#### Directions:
1. Rinse Potatoes
2. Cut Potatoes into cubes, leaving the skin on (they cook faster in cubes, I use approx. 1” x 1” cubes)
3. Put cubed potatoes into a med – large pot
4. Cover with water and bring to a boil.
5. Boil potatoes until a fork can easily go through the cubes (about 10 – 15 min)
6. Drain potatoes and place back into Pot
7. Put butter into potatoes (I usually slice it so it will melt faster)
8. Smash the potatoes and butter with a potato smasher
9. When all potatoes are smashed and butter is churned in, add the sour cream.
  - I use a mixing and smashing action with my potato smasher.
10. Add milk to get desired consistency for Smashed potatoes (I generally only use a splash or two)
11. Salt and pepper to taste
  - For more buttery potatoes use a full stick of butter
