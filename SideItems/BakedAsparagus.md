# Baked Asparagus

### Craig has made this many times.  Love it!  Although our pee stinks afterwards...

#### Ingredients
- 1 bunch of asparagus spears, trimmed
- 3 tablespoons of olive oil
- 1.5 tablespoons grated parmesan cheese
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon of salt
- 1/2 teaspoon of pepper
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice

#### Directions
- Preheat oven to 425 degrees
- Place the asparagus into a mixing bowl, and drizzle with the olive oil. Toss to coat the spears, then sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, garlic, salt, and pepper. Arrange the asparagus onto a baking sheet in a single layer.
- Bake in the preheated oven until just tender, 12 to 15 minutes depending on thickness. Sprinkle with lemon juice just before serving.
