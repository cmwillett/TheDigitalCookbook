# Quinoa Salad

### Can be used as a side item!

(Note: there are different types of quinoa, usually in the same area in the grocery store where you find dried beans and dried peas, also rice. I found a box that said it was pre-rinsed, ready to cook, otherwise you will need to put it in a fine strainer and rinse it thoroughly before cooking – just read the directions on the package.)

#### Ingredients:
- 1 cup quinoa
- 2 cups water

#### Directions:
1. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to a simmer for 15 minutes. Dump in a large bowl to cool.

### While that's boiling:

#### Ingredients:
- 1 cup chickpeas (rinsed)
- 1 cup cucumber (chopped)
- 1 cup red pepper (chopped)
- 1 cup orange pepper (chopped)
- 1 tablespoon cilantro (chopped fine)
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 lemon (or lime) juiced
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ¼ cup feta cheese (optional)

#### Directions:
1. In a small bowl, pour in the olive oil, lemon juice, salt and cilantro and stir.
2. Let sit while the quinoa cools off.
3. Fluff the quinoa and when completely cooled, add the first 4 ingredients and mix.
4. Then add the olive oil mixture and mix well.
5. Place in refrigerator to cool.
  - Another version may be to eliminate the chickpeas and feta cheese and add corn and black beans and red onions for a more southwestern version. I’ll try that next time.
