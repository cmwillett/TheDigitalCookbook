# Warm Spinach Salad with Olive Oil and Garlic

### Servings: 2
### Sounds good - for a salad...

#### Ingredients
- 1/4 cup chicken broth
- 2 teaspoons minced garlic (4 cloves)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
- Pinch of salt
- Pepper to taste
- 8 cups spinach
- 2 tablespoons grated parmesan cheese

#### Instructions:
1. Add the chicken broth and garlic to a large saute pan and place over medium heat.
2. Bring to a simmer.
3. Reduce heat to medium low, cover, and cook for 10 minutes to soften and mellow the garlic (the chicken broth should reduce by no more than half).
4. Whisk in the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt, and pepper.
5. Turn off the heat and add the spinach.
6. Using tongs, quickly toss the spinach in warm dressing just until coated.
7. Immediately transfer to serving plates.
8. Top with the grated Parmesan cheese and serve.
