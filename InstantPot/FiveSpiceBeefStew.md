# Instant Pot 5 Spice Beef Stew

### This has a unique flavor, but we loved it!

#### INGREDIENTS
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil or 1 tablespoon butter
- 2 pounds beef stew meat
- 1½ teaspoons kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon Chinese Five Spice seasoning
- 1 medium sweet yellow onion diced
- 3 cloves garlic minced
- ¼ cup tomato paste
- 32 ounces low-sodium beef broth
- 3 tablespoons Hoisin sauce
- 1 cup scrubbed and chopped carrots
- 1 sweet potato peeled and chopped
- 1 small bag of frozen peas
- 1 small bag of frozen green beans

#### INSTRUCTIONS
1. Sprinkle the stew meat with salt, pepper and Five-spice seasoning.
2. Set the Instant Pot to sauté. After 1 minute, add the olive oil and sesame oil. Place half of the stew meat in the pot and cook it until meat has seared on both sides. Transfer the meat to a plate and repeat with the remaining stew meat. Set aside.
    - Note:  I still prefer to do the sauteing in a pan on the stovetop instead of the instant pot...
3. If needed, add 1 tablespoon olive oil to the Instant Pot. Add the onion and sauté until onion is translucent. Add the minced garlic and stir.
4. Add the tomato paste, stir and cook for 1 minute.
5. Pour in the beef broth and scrape the bottom of the pot to loosen the brown bits.
6. Add Hoisin sauce and the seared beef. Mix well.
7. Add carrots, sweet potato, peas and green beans.
8. Close the lid on the Instant Pot and be sure the steam valve is closed.
9. Set the manual button to 25 minutes of high pressure and allow the pressure to release naturally.
10. When pressure has released, remove the lid and taste the stew. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.
11. This is delicious served on a bed of white rice and with a side of roasted broccoli.
12. Enjoy!
13. *Note: If stew needs thickening, mix 2 tablespoons cornstarch with 2 tablespoons cold water and add it to the stew. Stir to thicken.
